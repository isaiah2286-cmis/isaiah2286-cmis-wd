		<h3>
			History of creating lists and links
		</h3>
		<p>
			Today for the first time in my life, I have created a link inside my website. It looks great.	
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.</li>
			<li>Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"</li>
			<li>In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.
Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.</li>
			<li>In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.</li>
			<li>In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".</li>
			<li>In your old index.html, add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements. </li>
			<li>Turn in your work.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			History of creating table
		</h3>
		<p>
			Today I learned how to create a table for HTML.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a new folder in your repository called "tables"</li>
			<li>In the "tables" folder, create a new file called from your template "index.html"</li>
				<li>Be sure to use thead, tbody, and tfoot elements in your tables.</li>
			<li>Add html code to recreate the webpage below.</li>
		<li>second table will require the use of the colspan attribute.</li>
		<li>third table will require the use of the rowspan attribute.</li>
		<li>In your repository index.html file, add an article with a heading, paragraph description and this list of requirements. Also add a link to the tables/index.html file. </li>
		<li>Add a link from lists and links to this assignment as well.
Validate your code.</li>
		<li>Turn it in.</li>
		</ul>
